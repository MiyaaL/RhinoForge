# Knowledge workflows

## Query

1. Start at [INDEX.md](INDEX.md).
2. Read the smallest relevant concept or synthesis page.
3. Follow its public source links before changing code or making a support
   claim.
4. Use `rg` only after the indexed sources do not answer the question.

See [RETRIEVAL.md](RETRIEVAL.md) for the Markdown-first retrieval contract and
the boundary for optional semantic indexing.

For model assessment or implementation, use the
[`rhinoforge-port` skill](../.agents/skills/rhinoforge-port/SKILL.md) with
[model porting](../docs/model_porting.md).

## Add or update knowledge

1. Confirm the statement in public source or documentation.
2. Update the existing page that owns the fact; create a page only for a new,
   reusable concept.
3. Follow [SCHEMA.md](SCHEMA.md), add direct source links, and update
   [INDEX.md](INDEX.md).
4. Check relative links and scan the changed files for private infrastructure,
   credentials, restricted implementation detail, opaque asset internals, and
   diagnostic payloads.

## Save a reusable answer

1. First update an existing concept or synthesis page when it owns the result.
2. Add a short page under [queries/](queries/README.md) only when the original
   question and decision context remain useful.
3. Keep direct public source links and mark unresolved points; do not store raw
   chat transcripts or diagnostic artifacts.

## Add an external source

Prefer a stable public URL. When an offline snapshot materially improves
provenance or availability, follow [raw/README.md](raw/README.md), confirm its
license or redistribution basis, and cite it from a maintained page.

## Resolve conflicts

Use public API documentation for user-visible behavior and source for actual
implementation. Treat model-support status as profile-specific and defer to
[model support](../docs/model_support.md) and
[model validation policy](../docs/validation_policy.md). Update stale knowledge
in the same change; do not preserve conflicting summaries.
