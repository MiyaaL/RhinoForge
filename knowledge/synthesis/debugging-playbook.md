# Debugging and profiling playbook

Use this sequence for numerical mismatches, replay-only failures, unexpected
fallback, or performance regressions. It retains the reusable conclusions from
prior debugging practice without publishing session history or diagnostic
payloads.

## Fast triage order

1. **Bind the exact profile.** Record source revision, model/checkpoint revision,
   dtype, input envelope, TOML, Launch package, combined operator asset, and
   compatibility identifiers. Stop on any mismatch.
   [Release-quality checks](../../docs/model_testing.md#what-a-release-quality-model-check-still-needs)
2. **Reproduce both references and one RPU result.** Use the exact same-dtype
   executable for implementation parity and CPU FP32 as the precision anchor.
   Preserve output hashes and top-level numerical/task metrics before adding
   probes. Only if top-level evidence fails, compare the smallest divergent
   public model boundary.
   [Validation policy](../../docs/validation_policy.md)
3. **Prove the Graph lifecycle.** A repeated signature should show one BUILD,
   increasing REPLAY count, fixed cache size, no recapture, and a true cache
   invariant. Use `snapshot()`, `debug_bucket_counts()`,
   `dump_signature_tree()`, or `explain_miss()` to explain state; their output is
   diagnostic, not correctness evidence.
   Use `Graph.dump_replay_plan()` or `Graph.dump_tree()` when a pointer-free
   node/segment view is needed.
   [Graph API](../../docs/api_reference.md#graph-api)
4. **Repeat across warmup and input changes.** Check deterministic output across
   the supported warmup settings and exercise more than one real input. For
   image or multi-input paths, retain earlier outputs long enough to catch
   backing-storage reuse.
   [Porting pitfalls](../../docs/pitfalls.md)
5. **Check shared contracts before model math.** In order: weight conversion,
   replay-persistent SPM lifetime, address-versus-offset use, output ownership,
   DMA address lifetime, Graph signature completeness, model-state
   invalidation, then profile-specific computation.
   [Pitfalls overview](pitfalls-overview.md)
6. **Localize one boundary at a time.** Compare CPU and RPU at a stable public
   stage, identify the first transition, and split only that stage. A stage that
   receives different inputs may be an amplifier rather than the originating
   defect; use a shared-input A/B before changing product code.

## Multi-component policy checks

For Pi0.5, RhinoVLA, and other visual-language-action policies, keep the
preprocessed request and any stochastic starting state identical between the
reference and RPU paths. Check the visual output, prefix/text state, cache
progression, and action path independently before relying on the final action
chunk. A downstream component can consume the same wrong upstream state on two
comparison paths, so final-output agreement alone does not localize every
component.

For multiple images or repeated same-shape requests, retain the first output
while executing the next input and verify that its bytes and storage remain
independent. This catches output ownership mistakes that a one-input smoke test
cannot expose. [Porting pitfalls](../../docs/pitfalls.md)

## Performance diagnosis

Choose one mechanism according to the question:

| Question | Mechanism | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Which backend wrappers or accumulated regions are expensive? | `torch.rpu.set_profile(True)` | Warm first when measuring steady state and reset counters before the window. |
| Where is host/operator time spent? | `torch.profiler.profile(...)` | Profile a bounded call; keep warmup separate and expect tracing overhead. |

See [runtime profiling controls](../../docs/runtime_config.md#profiling-mechanisms)
and the [TOML profiling guide](../../docs/model_testing.md#torch-profile).

Do not use profiler-on latency as the release number. Torch traces may contain
tensor shapes and source paths. Review locally, publish only the necessary
summary, and never add generated trace directories to the repository.

## Stop conditions

- An end-to-end smoke run alone does not establish model support.
- A clean warning log does not establish Graph reuse.
- A Graph invariant does not establish numerical correctness.
- A faster run with changed output is a different numerical profile, not a
  performance result for the original profile.
- If one required reference, runtime asset, numerical gate, maximum-envelope
  run, or lifecycle check is missing, report it as pending or blocked.
