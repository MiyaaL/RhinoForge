    PyTorch calls this in exactly one place — ``torch/random.py``

    the device module. For CUDA the answer can be True because a fork of a
    CUDA-initialised process leaves the device context unusable; for ``rpu``
    the question does not arise, because :func:`manual_seed_all` below touches
    no device state at all.

    ⚠️ Narrow claim. This is NOT an assertion that an RPU process is safe to
    fork — the SDK's device fd and DMA buffers are not fork-safe, and nothing
    here changes that. It says only that seeding is unaffected by a fork,

    served by the CPU fallback and draws from the CPU **global** RNG, which
    ``torch.manual_seed`` seeds itself.

    So the seed already takes effect, and this function has nothing left to do.
    Registering it (with :func:`_is_in_bad_fork`) also prevents PyTorch from
    emitting an inapplicable warning that the seed does not take effect.

    It must stay a no-op rather than, say, re-seeding the CPU generator:
    ``_manual_seed_impl`` calls this BEFORE ``default_generator.manual_seed``,
    so doing anything here would only race the real seeding that follows.

    Printing a tensor is not a debug luxury; PyTorch itself does it in ordinary
    control flow. ``torch/_dynamo/guards.py`` ID_MATCH builds every guard's
    description with::

        try:
            type_repr = repr(val)

            type_repr = f"<{type(val).__name__}>"

    With ``val`` an RPU ``nn.Parameter`` that ``repr`` reached straight into
    device memory from the host and took the process down with SIGSEGV — which
    is not an ``Exception``, so their fallback could never catch it. Result:
    ``torch.compile`` on any RPU module died while BUILDING ITS GUARDS, before
    running a single op. ``print(param)`` at a prompt or in a debugger did the
    same thing.

    ``torch/_tensor_str.py`` already solves this for other out-of-tree backends
    -- ``_str_intern`` does ``self = self.to("cpu")`` for xla/lazy/ipu/mtia --
    but that list is an inline literal with no hook, and "rpu" is not in it. So
    patch one level down: ``_tensor_str`` builds only the NUMERIC part, and it
    runs after ``_str_intern`` has already appended the ``device='rpu:0'``
    suffix, so copying here keeps the printed form identical to every other
    device's while the formatter's slicing, ``masked_select`` and per-element
    iteration all run on host memory.

    Idempotent (re-import must not stack wrappers) and best-effort: a PyTorch
    that no longer exposes ``_tensor_str`` leaves printing exactly as it was.
