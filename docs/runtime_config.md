# Runtime configuration

[简体中文](runtime_config.zh.md) | English

RhinoForge has a small set of user-facing settings and a larger set of exact
model-profile and diagnostic controls. Set the complete environment before
importing `rpu_backend`; changing a profile in a live process is unsupported
unless a row explicitly says that it is read per call.

This page documents every environment reader currently retained under
`python/rpu_backend` and `src`, plus the Launch capacity inputs. Listing a
variable does not make an experimental combination supported.

## How to read the tables

Parser abbreviations:

- **PB(default)** is the shared Python boolean parser. It strips whitespace and
  accepts case-insensitive `1`/`true`/`on` and `0`/`false`/`off`/empty; any other
  value raises `ValueError`.
- **B01(default)** is a boolean read by both Python and native code. Only literal
  `0` and `1` are portable and accepted by the Python mirror.
- **E1** means unset is off and only exact literal `1` enables the path.
- **N1** means unset is off and exact `1` or lowercase `true` enables the native
  path. Rows call out different native parsers explicitly.

Read/lifecycle abbreviations:

- **IMPORT**: package or native-extension initialization; changing it requires a
  fresh process.
- **NATIVE**: cached on first native use; changing it requires a fresh process.
- **MODEL**: bound while constructing a model, policy, or weights; create a new
  model. Because RhinoForge permits one live fused policy per process, a fresh
  process is the safe replacement procedure.
- **BUILD**: bound while a handle or Graph is built; clear and rebuild every
  affected Graph and its owning model, or use a fresh process.
- **CALL**: read for each applicable call. If it changes execution shape or Graph
  topology, the row still requires a rebuilt Graph.

Use `0`/`1` in deployment manifests even when a wider parser is documented.
Facade defaults below are applied only by that named public facade; the raw
source default applies to direct adapter use.

## Precedence and reproducible profiles

When using `examples/run_model.py`, each allowlisted value in `[runner.env]`
overwrites the inherited value of the same name before importing `torch` or
`rpu_backend`. Variables omitted from the table retain their shell value. A
model facade then uses `setdefault` for any profile-owned defaults, so the
effective process environment still wins; direct adapter use receives the raw
source defaults documented below.

Deployment-owned paths and credentials do not belong in TOML. In particular,
set `RPU_KERNEL_LIB_PATH` in the verified deployment environment, and pass
cold per-handle planning through the loader's explicit `rpu_execution`
argument. The model preflight remains authoritative and may reject an ambient
environment or execution setting outside the exact profile.

For a reproducible run, record the TOML hash and the effective values of every
explicitly set runtime variable. Use a fresh process when changing an IMPORT,
NATIVE, MODEL, or BUILD setting; do not infer that mutating `os.environ` after
construction reconfigured an existing handle or Graph.

## TOML parameter catalog

The complete runner keeps four configuration layers separate:

| Table | Common fields | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| `[runner]` | `target` | Selects one of the targets reported by `examples/run_model.py --list-targets`. |
| `[runner.env]` | Any non-diagnostic variable documented on this page except `RPU_KERNEL_LIB_PATH` and credential-like names | Applied before importing PyTorch or RhinoForge. Omitted values remain inherited from the shell. Model-profile selectors should be changed only as a complete validated profile. |
| `[runner.torch_profile]` | `enabled`, `output`, `record_shapes`, `profile_memory`, `with_stack` | Configures the command-wide Torch trace. |
| `[runner.hw_perf]` | `enabled`, `output_dir`, `max_dumps` | Configures bounded r4 hardware kernel/DMA Chrome traces. The runner enters the context before the target starts and resets Graph caches when it exits. |
| `[rpu_execution.<stage>]` | `chunk_size`; `prefill` also accepts `padding_rows` and `padding_budget` | Cold per-handle planning. The target matrix below is an allowlist; unsupported stages or fields fail during configuration validation. |
| `[model]`, `[generation]`, `[request]` | Target-specific fields listed below | Consumed by the selected direct example. Paths and inputs remain deployment-owned. |
| `[runtime]` | RhinoVLA factory-defined fields only | A non-empty mapping is passed unchanged to the trusted external runtime factory. RhinoForge cannot safely invent or validate model-repository-specific names. |

`padding_rows` may be `"auto"` or an exact non-negative integer. An exact
integer and `padding_budget` are alternatives and cannot be active together.
All chunk sizes are `"auto"` or positive multiples of 16. The loader or policy
may further narrow every value to the admitted model profile.

`--check-config` validates `[runner.env]` names and TOML scalar types without
reimplementing every variable parser. The value grammar and exact-profile
compatibility in the tables below remain authoritative at construction or
preflight.

### Common and model-specific map

Each model profile has one template. The same file is accepted by the direct
example and contains the common runner and profiler fields plus every
applicable `rpu_execution` stage.

| Target / model family | Template | Accepted planning stages | Model and request fields | Model-owned runtime group |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `causal_lm` · Qwen3 | [`qwen3_0_6b.toml`](../examples/configs/qwen3_0_6b.toml) | `prefill` | `model.alias` or `model.checkpoint`, `model.local_files_only`; `generation.prompt`, `generation.max_new_tokens` | General/cache settings; exact quantized profiles may add their documented selectors |
| `causal_lm` · Llama | [`llama_3_2_1b.toml`](../examples/configs/llama_3_2_1b.toml) | `prefill` | Same CausalLM fields | General/cache settings |
| `qwen3_5_text` | [`qwen3_5_0_8b.toml`](../examples/configs/qwen3_5_0_8b.toml) | `prefill` | Same CausalLM fields | [Model-specific public settings](#model-specific-public-settings); prefer `rpu_execution` for new integrations |
| `qwen3_5_vision` | [`qwen3_5_vision_2b.toml`](../examples/configs/qwen3_5_vision_2b.toml) | `prefill` | Qwen3.5 model fields; image, prompt, and generation length | [Qwen3.5 Vision selectors](#qwen35-vision-selectors); exact status is profile-specific |
| `qwen3_vl` | [`qwen3_vl_2b.toml`](../examples/configs/qwen3_vl_2b.toml) | `prefill`, `vision` | `model.alias` or `model.checkpoint`, `model.local_files_only`; exactly one of `request.image` or `request.images`, plus prompt and generation length | [Qwen3-VL shared Vision profile](#qwen3-vl-shared-vision-profile) |
| `dinov3` | [`dinov3_vit_b.toml`](../examples/configs/dinov3_vit_b.toml) | `vision` | `model.alias` or `model.checkpoint`, `model.local_files_only`; `request.image` | General/cache settings |
| `siglip` | [`siglip.toml`](../examples/configs/siglip.toml) | `vision` | Pi0.5 bundle alias/checkpoint and one or more image paths | [Pi0.5 profile](#pi05-profile); Component-only output |
| `pi05` | [`pi05_libero.toml`](../examples/configs/pi05_libero.toml) | `prefill`, `vision`, `action` | `model.alias` or `model.checkpoint`; `request.batch_file`, `request.num_steps`, `request.prepare_graphs` | [Pi0.5 profile](#pi05-profile) and the model-specific public settings |
| `wall_oss` | [`wall_oss.toml`](../examples/configs/wall_oss.toml) | `prefill`, `vision`, `action` | checkpoint/alias, precision and FP16 source, dataset/cameras, state/action fields; images, instruction, proprioception, and noise | [Wall-OSS profile](#wall-oss-profile) |
| `hy_embodied` | [`hy_embodied.toml`](../examples/configs/hy_embodied.toml) | None; non-empty `rpu_execution` is rejected | checkpoint/alias, `dtype`, `prefix_len`; three images, instruction, state, noise seed | [Hy-Embodied profile](#hy-embodied-profile) |
| `gemma4` | [`gemma4.toml`](../examples/configs/gemma4.toml) | `prefill` (`chunk_size` only) | checkpoint/alias, local-only flag, max sequence length and Source-only acknowledgement; prompt and generation length | General/cache settings; Source-only |
| `gr00t` | [`gr00t.toml`](../examples/configs/gr00t.toml) | `prefill`, `vision`, `action` | GR00T and Qwen3-VL checkpoint/alias, embodiment ID and Source-only acknowledgement; caller-preprocessed tensor file, seed and step count | [GR00T profile](#gr00t-profile); Source-only |
| `lingbot2` | [`lingbot2.toml`](../examples/configs/lingbot2.toml) | None | checkpoint/alias, exact dtype/camera/image/token profile and controlled acknowledgement; three images, instruction, proprioception and seed | [LingBot-VLA-V2 profile](#lingbot-vla-v2-profile) |
| `g05` | [`g05.toml`](../examples/configs/g05.toml) | None | checkpoint/alias, max sequence length and controlled acknowledgement | Integration check only; official model repository constructs the policy |
| `internvla_navdp` | [`internvla_navdp.toml`](../examples/configs/internvla_navdp.toml) | None | root alias/checkpoint, NavDP checkpoint, SHA256 manifest and controlled acknowledgement; caller embeddings, sample count and seed | [InternVLA-N1 and NavDP profiles](#internvla-n1-and-navdp-profiles); component only |
| `rhinovla` | [`rhinovla.toml`](../examples/configs/rhinovla.toml) | Only stages and fields declared by the trusted runtime factory | `model.checkpoint`, `model.runtime_factory`; `request.request_json`; factory-defined `[runtime]` | [RhinoVLA profile](#rhinovla-profile) plus the external factory contract |

The model-owned runtime groups are documented exhaustively below because they
are real source readers, but most are sealed profile selectors rather than
independent user tuning knobs. Templates show the stable public configuration
surface and do not enable every selector with a guessed value.
Copying all selector defaults into TOML could override a facade-owned profile
and silently create an unvalidated combination.

## General and cache settings

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_KERNEL_LIB_PATH` | Combined operator asset beside the extension; existing file path with an adjacent `.kernels` manifest | First asset access / **IMPORT** | Process-wide asset selection. A missing, incompatible, or untrusted asset or manifest prevents safe execution. |
| `RPU_MODEL_CACHE` | `~/.cache/rhinoforge/models`; directory path | Package bootstrap for HF defaults / **IMPORT**, alias resolution / **CALL** | Root for RhinoForge model aliases. An explicit value also supplies HF cache defaults; a post-import change affects later aliases but does not reliably reconfigure already imported HF components. |
| `RPU_LOG_LEVEL` | `3`; decimal integer `0..5`; invalid values warn and fall back to `3` | Native-extension load / **IMPORT** | Process logging: `0` silent through `5` trace. High levels add output and may expose paths or request metadata. |
| `RPU_WARMUP` | `0`; integer, invalid becomes `0`, negative clamps to `0` | Adapter construction / **MODEL** | Warmup forward count for adapters that support it. Adds startup work and can consume diagnostic budgets. |
| `RPU_CAUSAL_PREFILL_PADDING_BUDGET` | `64`; non-negative decimal integer | Eligible causal prefill planning / **CALL**; rebuild Graph for a new plan | Maximum optional rows for the generic Qwen3/Llama planner. `0` disables optional padding; a changed plan changes Graph signatures. |
| `LKN_MAX_BATCH_ENTRIES` | `65536`; positive decimal, invalid/empty/zero uses default, cap `4194304` | Launch initialization and Graph planning / **IMPORT** | Process capacity for batched submissions. Too small rejects a Graph; excessive values reserve more host memory. |
| `LKN_KD_BUF_MB` | `8`; positive MiB, invalid/empty/zero uses default, cap `256` | Launch initialization and Graph planning / **IMPORT** | Process command-buffer capacity. Too small rejects a Graph; excessive values increase memory use. |
| `LKN_INSTR_BUF_MB` | `64`; positive MiB, invalid/empty/zero uses default, cap `1024` | Launch initialization and Graph planning / **IMPORT** | Process execution-buffer capacity. Too small rejects a Graph; excessive values increase memory use. |
| `HF_HOME` | Hugging Face default; directory path | Package bootstrap and HF initialization / **IMPORT** | Standard HF cache root. `RPU_MODEL_CACHE` supplies it only with `setdefault`; caller values win. |
| `HF_HUB_CACHE` | Hugging Face default; directory path | Package bootstrap and HF initialization / **IMPORT** | Standard Hub cache. An explicit `RPU_MODEL_CACHE` supplies `<HF_HOME>/hub` only when unset. |
| `HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE` | Hugging Face default; directory path | Package bootstrap and HF initialization / **IMPORT** | Compatibility Hub cache variable, handled like `HF_HUB_CACHE`; keep both consistent. |

Set all three `LKN_*` values before importing the backend. A facade may choose
larger defaults before its first adapter import, but it cannot resize a Launch
runtime that is already loaded. Larger capacities do not make an unsupported
model profile supported.

## Model-specific public settings

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_QWEN3_SPM_KV_BY_MHA` | `1`; exact `0` or `1` | Qwen3 fused-handle construction / **MODEL** | Allows the certified short-prefill profile to keep transient K/V in SPM when the exact plan fits. `0` pins the DDR-cache attention path; unsupported shapes fall back to DDR automatically. |
| `QWEN3_5_TEXT_CHUNK` | `0` auto; decimal `0` or integer at least `64` | Qwen3.5 text installation / **MODEL** | Cold per-handle prefill cap. Invalid or smaller positive values fail; use `rpu_execution` for new integrations. |
| `QWEN3_5_TEXT_PADDING_BUDGET` | `64`; decimal integer `0..64` | Qwen3.5 text installation / **MODEL** | Cold optional-padding budget. It changes prefill plans and Graph signatures. |
| `RPU_QWEN3_5_FREE_HF_WEIGHTS` | **PB(true)** | Qwen3.5 weight installation / **MODEL** | `1` releases original HF weights after transformed copies exist; `0` retains them and increases host memory. |
| `RPU_PI05_SIGLIP_W8A16` | **PB(true)** for an int8/uint8 bundle, otherwise **PB(false)** | Pi0.5 SigLIP installation / **MODEL** | Selects the existing quantized projection path. It must match checkpoint dtype and numerical validation. |
| `RPU_PI05_SIGLIP_W8A16_SCOPE` | `all`; `all`/`full`, `row`/`safe`, `out`/`out_proj`/`o`, `fc2`/`mlp.fc2`, or `none`/`0`/`off`/`false`/empty | Pi0.5 SigLIP installation / **MODEL** | Chooses quantized projection groups. Unknown text fails; every scope is a distinct numeric profile. |
| `RPU_PI05_ADARMS_DENSE_W8A16` | **PB(true)** for a quantized expert, otherwise **PB(false)** | Pi0.5 AdaRMS installation / **MODEL** | Selects quantized AdaRMS dense weights. Mismatch with the loaded profile fails or changes numerics. |

Prefer the public loader or policy `rpu_execution` argument for chunk and
padding choices. It is validated before weight loading and is immutable after
binding.

## Fail-closed evaluation gates

These gates default off and accept only exact literal `1`. They are read during
preflight or construction (**MODEL**) and require a fresh model/process to
change. Enabling one admits a controlled evaluation path; it does not certify
the path, relax numerical gates, or expand the supported-model matrix.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QWEN3_5_VISION_ALLOW_NUMERIC_BLOCKED` | `0`; **E1** | Qwen3.5/G0.5 Vision preflight / **MODEL** | Enables controlled evaluation of numeric-blocked Qwen3.5 Vision 2B/4B and generic G0.5 Vision. It does not certify image output. |
| `QWEN3_VL_32B_ALLOW_GRAPH_BLOCKED` | `0`; **E1** | Preflight / **MODEL** | Exact Qwen3-VL 32B W8A16 graph-blocked evaluation only. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_ALLOW_UNVALIDATED` | `0`; **E1** | Preflight / **MODEL** | LingBot-VLA-V2 controlled profiles; output is not robot certified. |
| `RPU_INTERNVLA_N1_ALLOW_NUMERIC_BLOCKED` | `0`; **E1** | Preflight / **MODEL** | InternVLA-N1 legacy controlled evaluation. |
| `RPU_S2_SDPA_BF16` | Unset/empty/`0` only; literal `1` and all other values are rejected | Preflight / **MODEL** | InternVLA policy tripwire for an unavailable asset; leave off. |

## Shared advanced execution selectors

These are profile-owned. A facade may set a validated value before model
construction; ambient overrides can break graph, memory, or numerical
contracts.

### Collective execution

Residual reduction has no public route, chunk, ring, or two-stage selector.
The shared wrapper always uses the generated eight-core ring and chooses its
schedule from validated geometry. Partial producers clear inactive shards
before reduction. See
[Automatic residual reduction](../knowledge/concepts/allreduce-routing.md).

### Graph and replay

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_DEEP_FAST_REPLAY` | Off; any non-empty value whose first character is not `0` enables | Fused-handle construction / **MODEL** | Skips audited setup work on full-body replay. A profile must prove every skipped input/layout remains valid. |
| `RPU_FASTREPLAY_SKIP_SYNC` | Off; non-empty value not starting with `0` enables | Graph BUILD / **BUILD** | Skips a redundant mutable-parameter scan only for a fully skipped replay. Wrong use can replay stale parameters. |
| `RPU_FUSED_COEXIST_KEEP_PERSISTENT_GEN` | Off; exact `1`, `true`, `True`, or `on` enables | First native coexistence use / **NATIVE** | Retains a persistent SPM generation across profile-owned subsystem handoff. Wrong ownership can corrupt later execution. |
| `RPU_GRAPH_DEFER_TO_COPY` | No independent default; legacy alias accepts `auto`/empty, `0`/`off`/`false`, or any other non-empty value for forced on | First host-op gate use / **NATIVE** | Consulted only when `RPU_GRAPH_HOST_OP_DEFER_GATE` is unset. Avoid setting both. |
| `RPU_GRAPH_HOST_OP_DEFER_GATE` | `auto`; `auto`/empty, `0`/`off`/`false`, or any other non-empty value for forced on | First host-op gate use / **NATIVE** | Controls deferral of stable host inputs during capture. Forced-on with unstable storage risks stale data. |
| `RPU_SKIP_IDLE_RECORD_FUNCTION` | Off; `1`/`on`/`true`/`True` enable | First Python graph scope / **MODEL** | Omits idle profiler scopes only while the profiler is off. It preserves scopes when profiling and otherwise reduces host overhead. |

### KV, linear, normalization, and scheduling

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_ADARMS_FUSED_BCAST` | Off; non-empty except `0`/`false`/`False` | Handle/Graph build / **BUILD** | Fuses profile-owned AdaRMS broadcasts. The owning layout must be contiguous and stable. |
| `RPU_KVINSERT_HYBRID3_V16` | Off; non-empty except `0`/`false`/`False` | Each KV insertion / **CALL**; rebuild Graph | Selects a three-part aligned/tail schedule. Shape and cache signatures must be revalidated. |
| `RPU_KVINSERT_HYBRID_V16` | Off; non-empty except `0`/`false`/`False` | Each KV insertion / **CALL**; rebuild Graph | Selects an aligned bulk/tail schedule. Facades may own it; arbitrary enablement changes graph topology. |
| `RPU_KVINSERT_V16` | On; exact `0` or `false` disables, all other values enable | First native use / **NATIVE** | Selects the aligned KV-insert route when admitted. Disabling changes scheduling and performance, not logical cache length. |
| `RPU_KVINSERT_V16_ANY_TP` | Off; non-empty except `0`/`false`/`False` | First native use / **NATIVE** | Allows the aligned route for additional whole-head parallel factors. Unsupported geometry can fail admission. |
| `RPU_LINEAR_ACC32` | Off; strict `0`/`1`, `false`/`true`, or `off`/`on` with listed case variants; invalid fails | First native use / **NATIVE** | Chooses FP32 accumulation for tiled linear families. It changes tiles, memory use, performance, and numerics. |
| `RPU_RMSNORM_NEWTON` | Off; strict `0`/`1`, `false`/`true`, or `off`/`on` with listed case variants; invalid fails | First native use / **NATIVE** | Selects refined normalization. It changes numerics and can change available schedules. |
| `RPU_RMSNORM_VWARP` | `0`; `0`, `16`, `32`, or `auto`; unknown text falls back to `0` | First native use / **NATIVE** | Selects an admitted vector row schedule. Unsupported divisibility falls back; timing changes. |

<a id="qwen35-vision-selectors"></a>
### Qwen3.5 Vision selectors

These selectors apply only after the numeric-blocked controlled-evaluation gate
has admitted Qwen3.5 Vision. They do not expand its Experimental status.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QWEN3_5_VISION_CHUNK` | Auto; decimal integer, empty/non-positive means auto | First native vision plan / **NATIVE** | Caps Qwen3.5 Vision chunking. Positive overrides must remain in the admitted shape and memory envelope. |
| `RPU_VISION_MERGER` | **PB(true)** | Qwen3.5 Vision setup / **MODEL** | Enables the RPU merger path. `0` selects a fallback and changes performance/numerics. |
| `RPU_VISION_STEP0` | **PB(true)** | Qwen3.5 Vision setup / **MODEL** | Enables the RPU first-stage path. `0` selects a fallback and changes performance/numerics. |

<a id="gr00t-profile"></a>
## GR00T profile

The public GR00T builder supplies its facade defaults before construction.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_GR00T_KVPAD16` | Raw off; facade `1`; native `1` or a value beginning with `t`/`T` enables | First native KV setup / **NATIVE** | Pads and masks KV rows for the GR00T expert. It changes cache layout and Graph signatures. |
| `RPU_GR00T_PARTIAL_MROPE` | Raw **PB(false)**; facade **PB(true)** | GR00T construction / **MODEL** | Uses precomputed partial multimodal position tables. |
| `RPU_GR00T_W8A16` | **PB(false)** | GR00T weight installation / **MODEL** | Quantizes the admitted backbone and action projections and changes numerics. |

## Hy-Embodied profile

`HyEmbodiedPolicy` applies a complete scoped profile before construction. The
raw defaults below describe direct adapter use; the facade defaults named in a
row are the normal public-policy values. Use a fresh process to switch policy
profiles.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_HY_VLA_ACTION_MLP_MC` | Raw unset means 8 cores; `0`/`off`/`false`/`False` means 1, all other values mean 8; facade `1` | Weight/build setup / **MODEL** | Selects multi-core action-MLP execution. It changes reduction order and must retain profile numerical gates. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_ATTN_TP8` | Raw off; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; facade `1` | Weight installation / **MODEL** | Replicates KV heads for eight-core attention. Cache geometry and weights must be rebuilt. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_CACHING_ALLOC` | On; `0`/`false`/`False`/`off` disables | Hy-VLA construction / **MODEL** | Enables the process caching allocator for this policy. It changes memory retention; call `empty_cache()` before measuring free memory. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_DENOISE_UNROLL` | Raw off; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; facade `1` | Action construction / **MODEL** | Records the denoise loop as one profile-owned Graph. It changes Euler-state precision and numerical results. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_FAST_REPLAY` | Raw off; `0`/`off`/`false`, `1`/`on`/`true`, or a value naming `vit`, `vlm`, and/or `expert`; facade `1` | First native subsystem use / **NATIVE** | Skips audited layer-body emission on replay. Wrong use can leave dynamic inputs stale. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_FAST_REPLAY_PRELOAD` | Raw off; `0`/`off`/`false`, `1`/`on`/`true`, or a value naming `vit`, `vlm`, and/or `expert`; facade `1` | First native subsystem use / **NATIVE** | Also skips audited preload work on replay. It requires stable persistent state. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_FUSED_MERGER` | Raw off; Python accepts `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; native mirror requires literal `0`/`1`; facade `1` | Vision construction / **MODEL** | Folds the vision merger into the graph. Parser mismatch is prevented by using only `0`/`1`. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_KVPAD16` | Raw off; `0`/`off`/`false`, `1`/`on`/`true`, or a value naming `vit`, `vlm`, and/or `expert`; facade `1` | First native subsystem use / **NATIVE** | Pads/masks expert KV rows. It changes cache layout and signatures. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_MASK_ONCE` | Raw off; `0`/`off`/`false`, `1`/`on`/`true`, or a value naming `vit`, `vlm`, and/or `expert`; facade `1` | First native subsystem use / **NATIVE** | Reuses an invariant mask upload. It is unsafe when mask contents or storage can change. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_MERGER_IN_GRAPH` | Raw off; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; facade `1` | Vision construction / **MODEL** | Places the enabled fused merger inside capture. Requires `RPU_HY_VLA_FUSED_MERGER=1`. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_MOT_NORM_NOMERGE` | `both`; `0`/`off`/`false`, `1`/`on`/`true`/`both`, or a value containing `qkv` and/or `mlp` | First native VLM use / **NATIVE** | Selects profile-specific norm/merge scheduling. It changes temporary-memory and graph structure. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_PARTIAL_ROPE` | Raw off; `0`/`off`/`false`, `1`/`on`/`true`, or CSV scopes `vit`, `vlm`, `expert`; facade `expert,vlm` | First native subsystem use / **NATIVE** | Uses precomputed partial position tables for selected subsystems. Scope mismatch changes position semantics. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_PATCH_EMBED_IN_GRAPH` | On; `0`/`false`/`False`/`off` disables; facade `1` | Vision construction / **MODEL** | Captures device patch embedding. Disabling selects a different host/device boundary. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_PATCH_EMBED_MC` | Raw unset means 8 cores; `0`/`false`/`False` means 1; facade `1` | Weight and vision construction / **MODEL** | Selects multi-core patch embedding. Python/native state must agree; rebuild weights and Graph. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_PERSIST_HANDLES` | Raw off; `0`/`off`/`false`/empty, `1`/`on`/`true` for all, or CSV subset `vit`, `vlm`, `expert`; facade `1` | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Keeps selected handles alive across calls. It increases retained memory and enforces one-policy ownership. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_PREFIX_TEMPLATE` | On; `0`/`false`/`False`/`off` disables | Prompt construction / **MODEL** | Enables the profile prompt template. Changing it changes token input, not merely performance. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_PROJ1_IN_MERGER` | On; `0`/`off`/`false`/`False` disables; native mirror uses the same variable | Vision construction / **MODEL** | Includes the first projection in the merger path. Use literal `0`/`1`; disagreement breaks output shape/ownership. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_Q_INPLACE` | Raw off; non-empty except `0`/`off`/`false`; facade `1` | First native vision use / **NATIVE** | Reuses the query buffer in place. It is safe only when the profile proves the prior value dead. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_RMSNORM_PAD16` | Raw off; `0`/`off`/`false`, `1`/`on`/`true`, or a value naming `vit`, `vlm`, and/or `expert` | First native subsystem use / **NATIVE** | Pads selected normalization rows. It changes layout and Graph census. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_SILU_MUL` | Raw off; `0`/`off`/`false`, `1`/`on`/`true`, or CSV scopes `vit`, `vlm`, `expert`; facade `expert` | First native subsystem use / **NATIVE** | Fuses the selected activation/multiply schedule. It needs per-scope numerical validation. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_VIT_PACKED` | Raw off; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; facade `1` | Vision construction / **MODEL** | Packs the vision-tower execution profile. It changes shape/layout contracts and requires rebuilt weights/Graph. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_W4A16` | Off; `0`/`off`/`false`/`False`/empty, `1`/`on`/`true`/`True`/`all`, or CSV subset `vit`, `vlm`, `expert`, `vlm_text`, `vlm_vision` | Weight installation / **MODEL** | Selects W4A16 per scope; W4 takes precedence over W8 on overlap and unsupported scopes fail. Numeric profile changes. |
| `RPU_HY_VLA_W8A16` | Raw off; facade maps `fp16`→`0`, `w8a16`→`all`, `w8a16-expert`→`expert`, `w8a16-expert-vlmv`→`expert,vlm_vision`, `w8a16-vlm`→`vlm`, `w8a16-vit`→`vit`, `w8a16-no-vlm`→`vit,expert`; also accepts the W4 row's exact enum/CSV grammar | Weight installation / **MODEL** | Selects W8A16 per scope. It must match checkpoint/source weights and the named precision profile. |

## InternVLA-N1 and NavDP profiles

The controlled InternVLA path also requires a caller-supplied SHA256-pinned
asset manifest through its Python API; no environment path replaces it.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_INTERNVLA_DINO_FINAL_NORM_RPU` | **PB(true)** | DINO tower construction / **MODEL** | Runs the final normalization on RPU. `0` changes the host/device boundary and timing. |
| `RPU_INTERNVLA_DINO_NORM_FOLD` | **PB(false)** | DINO tower construction / **MODEL** | Folds input normalization into patch weights. It changes installed weights and must be rebuilt. |
| `RPU_INTERNVLA_HOST_CACHE` | **PB(true)** | Backbone construction / **MODEL** | Enables host memoization and stable owners. Disabling increases repeated host work. |
| `RPU_NAVDP_DENOISE_UNROLL` | Off; stripped `1`/`true`/`True` enables, other values disable | NavDP action call / **CALL**; rebuild Graph | Captures the fixed denoise loop. It changes Graph topology and step execution. |
| `RPU_NAVDP_BATCH` | On; stripped `1`/`true`/`True` enables, other values disable | First unrolled action dispatch / **CALL**; rebuild Graph/model | Batches trajectories. When on, sample count is fixed after first dispatch; later mismatches fail. |
| `RPU_NAVDP_SPM_KV_BY_MHA` | `1`; exact `0` or `1` | NavDP fused-handle construction / **MODEL** | Allows the certified initial self-attention profile to use transient SPM K/V when its exact joint layout fits. `0` pins that attention to DDR; ineligible calls remain on DDR. |

<a id="lingbot-vla-v2-profile"></a>
## LingBot-VLA-V2 profile

Prefer `Lingbot2Policy.from_checkpoint(..., runtime_env=...)`. The facade
validates an exact allowlist, applies a full snapshot before adapter import, and
restores the shell environment on close; native state is still process-cold, so
use a fresh process for another profile.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_ADARMS_DIRECT_SCHEDULE` | Raw/facade `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on` | Expert construction / **MODEL** | Uses a direct indexed AdaRMS schedule. It conflicts with denoise unroll and requires expert replay. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_BASE_W8A16` | Raw `0`; **E1**; W8/W4 facades `1` | Weight conversion / **MODEL** | Quantizes shared/base expert projections. It is part of the complete precision profile, not an independent toggle. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_DENOISE_UNROLL` | Raw `0`; facade `1`; facade normalizes only exact `1` to on | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Records the fixed ten-step denoise Graph and uses FP16 Euler state. `0` restores the host loop and changes numerics. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_ENCODER_1THREAD` | `1`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on` enables | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Runs small host encoder work with one thread. `0` uses the caller's process-wide thread setting. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_EXPERT_REPLAY` | Facade `1`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on` | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Enables stable expert Graph replay. It requires stable input owners; disabling increases build/dispatch work. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_EXPERT_W4A16` | Raw `0`; **E1**; W4 facade `1` | Weight conversion / **MODEL** | Selects W4A16 routed-expert weights. It wins over W8 if both are set; use only the complete W4 profile. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_EXPERT_W8A16` | Raw `0`; **E1**; W8 facade `1` | Weight conversion / **MODEL** | Selects W8A16 routed-expert weights unless W4 is on. Numeric profile changes. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_FP16_TOP4` | Native default on unless dense-router diagnostic is enabled; facade `1`; exact `0`/`1` | Expert weight installation / **MODEL** | Keeps strict FP16 top-4 routing. Disabling without the dense diagnostic fails; routing changes are accuracy-sensitive. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_GROUPED_EXPERTS` | Raw `0`; **E1**; W8/W4/FP16 facades `1` | Weight conversion and handle build / **MODEL** | Selects packed grouped experts. It must agree with weight format and row-chunk profile. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_HOST_PREFIX_OPT` | Facade `1`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on` | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Keeps stable prompt-prefix owners and memoization. Required for VLM replay and direct-prefix output. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_LEGACY_PREPROC` | `0`; **E1** | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Compatibility override that forces legacy preprocessing. It changes model input and is not a performance-only switch. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_PREFILL_FAST_REPLAY` | Raw `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; facade `1` | Prefill handle setup / **MODEL** | Enables audited prefill body replay skips. Requires VLM replay and stable prefix storage. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_PREFILL_W4A16` | Raw/facade `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on` | Weight conversion / **MODEL** | Restricted option quantizing only admitted prefill projections to W4A16. Ordinary W4 uses prefill W8A16 instead. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_PREFILL_W8A16` | Raw `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; W8/W4 facades `1` | Weight conversion / **MODEL** | Selects W8A16 prefill projections. It must be part of the complete precision profile. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_PREPROC` | `exact`; lower-case `exact`, `fast`, or `legacy`; other facade input normalizes to `exact` before build | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Selects preprocessing semantics and therefore changes model input. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_QWEN3VL_BASE` | Packaged/registry fallback; non-empty local directory containing a valid config | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Overrides the Qwen3-VL base assets. Wrong or untrusted contents fail validation; it is not a download credential. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_VISION_DIRECT_PREFIX` | Facade `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on` | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Writes fused vision results into stable prefix owners. Requires host-prefix optimization, VLM replay, batching, and fused merger. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_VISION_DIRECT_PREFIX_NO_OUTPUT` | Facade `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on` | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Suppresses the extra vision return only with direct-prefix enabled. Wrong pairing fails. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_VISION_FAST_REPLAY` | Raw `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; facade `1` | Vision handle setup / **MODEL** | Enables audited vision replay skips. It requires the named vision topology and stable dynamic inputs. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_VISION_W8A16` | Raw `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on`; W8/W4 facades `1` | Vision weight conversion / **MODEL** | Selects W8A16 vision projections. It changes numerics and must match the complete checkpoint profile. |
| `RPU_LINGBOT2_VLM_REPLAY` | Defaults `1` when host-prefix optimization is on, otherwise `0`; `1`/`true`/`True`/`on` | Policy construction / **MODEL** | Enables cross-call VLM prefill replay. `1` with unstable prefix storage is rejected to prevent stale reads. |

## Pi0.5 profile

The Pi0.5 loader owns these settings. Graph selectors must be fixed before
model construction and first capture.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_PI05_ADARMS_GRAPH` | **PB(true)** | AdaRMS construction / **MODEL** | Enables the AdaRMS GraphCache path. `0` uses the eager fallback and changes timing/lifecycle. |

| `RPU_PI05_DENOISE_UNROLL` | Raw **PB(false)**; Pi adapter supplies `1` | Action construction / **MODEL** | Records the fixed denoise loop in one Graph and uses FP16 Euler state. It changes numerics versus the host loop. |
| `RPU_PI05_EMBED_PREFIX_PATCH` | **PB(true)** | Adapter class-patch installation / **MODEL** | Enables the supported prefix-embedding patch. Change it only in a fresh process because class hooks are process state. |
| `RPU_PI05_EULER_FP16` | **PB(false)** | Each action call / **CALL**; rebuild prepared Graph profile | Uses FP16 rather than host-FP32 Euler state. It directly changes action numerics. |
| `RPU_PI05_FUSED_DENOISE` | **PB(true)** | Action construction / **MODEL** | Uses the fused denoise subsystem. `0` selects the legacy per-step path and changes topology/performance. |
| `RPU_PI05_GEMMA_GRAPH` | **PB(true)** | VLM construction / **MODEL** | Enables the Gemma GraphCache path. It requires stable prefix/cache owners. |
| `RPU_PI05_KEEP_CPU` | Unset/empty only; any non-empty value, including `0`, raises | Pi0.5 installation / **MODEL** | Retired-path tripwire. CPU weight retention through this variable is intentionally unsupported. |
| `RPU_PI05_KVINSERT_PAD16` | **B01(false)** | Expert construction / **MODEL** | Pads and masks KV rows. It changes cache layout and Graph signatures. |
| `RPU_PI05_PREFIX_MASK_CACHE` | **PB(true)** | Each action call / **CALL** | Reuses a one-entry host mask cache. `0` recomputes it; correctness still requires stable Graph inputs. |
| `RPU_PI05_PREFIX_PAD16` | **PB(true)** | Prefix planning / **CALL**; rebuild Graph for a new plan | Adds masked prefix padding for admitted shapes. It changes execution length/signature, not logical prefix length. |

| `RPU_PI05_SIGLIP_GRAPH` | **PB(true)** | SigLIP construction / **MODEL** | Enables the SigLIP GraphCache path. `0` is a diagnostic fallback with different timing. |

## Qwen3-VL shared Vision profile

These variables are consumed by Qwen3-VL Vision and by VLA facades that embed
that tower. Facades may set exact defaults before model construction.

|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_QWEN3VL_VISION_BATCH` | **PB(false)** | Vision forward / **CALL**; rebuild Graph | Packs compatible images/views. It changes Graph signatures and memory; facade constraints still cap shapes. |

## RhinoVLA profile

These are source-level integration controls. Use the model repository's
runtime factory and an exact validated configuration; a RhinoForge switch by
itself is not an end-to-end contract.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_RHINOVLA_DENOISE_STATIC_CONTEXT_CACHE` | Off; non-empty except `0`/`false`/`False` | First native action use / **NATIVE** | Caches denoise context proven static by the factory. Wrong use reuses stale observations. |

| `RPU_RHINOVLA_VISION_RPU_MERGER_NORM` | **PB(false)** | Vision installation / **MODEL** | Runs merger normalization on RPU. It changes the boundary and numerical profile. |
| `RPU_RHINOVLA_VISION_RPU_MERGER_OUTPUT_RPU` | **PB(false)** | Vision installation / **MODEL** | Keeps merger output on RPU. Consumers must accept device-resident output and stable ownership. |
| `RPU_RHINOVLA_VISION_SKIP_RAW_SNAPSHOTS` | **PB(false)** | Vision installation / **MODEL** | `1` suppresses raw debug snapshots. Leaving it off adds memory/synchronization and may retain sensitive model inputs/intermediates. |

## Wall-OSS profile

`WallOssPolicy` supplies validated facade defaults before model construction.
Prompt selectors change the actual model input and must never be treated as
performance-only switches.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RPU_WALL_OSS_ACTION_FP32_TAIL` | **PB(false)** | Each denoise call / **CALL**; rebuild prepared Graph profile | Uses host FP32 for the Euler tail. It changes action numerics and conflicts with fused/unrolled execution. |

## Diagnostic-only inventory

The comprehensive public runner rejects every variable in this section when it
appears in TOML. A developer may still set one explicitly in the shell for a
controlled local investigation. These controls can change execution, dump model
data, expose tensor summaries or timing structure, or invalidate correctness/performance
claims. Leave them unset in production and review every generated artifact before
sharing it.

| Variable | Unset/default and accepted values | Read / change | Scope, effect, and risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QWEN3_5_VISION_DBG_Q` | Off; exact `1` or lowercase `true` | First native debug check / **NATIVE** | Enables the Qwen3.5 Vision query probe path. It adds captures/synchronization and may expose intermediates. |

It changes FP16 reduction order and is not certified for release. |
| `RPU_QWEN35_WALL_PREFIX_COPY_ONCE` | `0`; exact `1` enables | Wall Qwen3.5 action request / **CALL**; fresh process | Diagnostic-only arm that copies the six physical K/V prefixes once per public request and reuses the independent action-owned prefix across ten suffix steps. It relies on the fixed Wall suffix-write contract and requires same-noise parity and cache-integrity checks. |
| `RPU_ALL_GATHER_FORCE_MULTI_CORE` | Off; **N1** | First native use / **NATIVE** | Forces the multi-core schedule for A/B comparison. It is not a generally supported performance selector. |

| `RPU_DYNAMO_MATERIALIZE_BREAKS` | **PB(false)** | Dynamo partitioning / **CALL**; recompile | Materializes partition breaks. It changes graph boundaries and adds transfers, so it is only a compiler diagnostic. |
| `RPU_GRAPH_DDR_SPM_LOG` | Off; non-empty whose first character is not `0` | First data-node execution / **NATIVE** | Logs node indexes, byte counts, and a bounded source checksum. Output is model-data-derived and logging changes timing. |

| `RPU_KVINSERT_V16_TRACE` | Off; any present value except exact `0` or `false`; an empty exported value enables | First native use / **NATIVE** | Logs KV route selection and shapes. It is diagnostic output, not proof of cache correctness. |
| `RPU_L2_BUFONLY` | Off by absence; any presence, including `0`, enables | Grouped-expert Graph emission / **BUILD** | Declares grouped buffers but runs the per-expert route for bisection. Changes graph and performance. |

| `RPU_L2_RCHUNK` | Runtime fallback `256`; positive decimal; supported grouped profiles require exact `1632` | Weight/profile validation (**MODEL**) and Graph emission (**BUILD**); fresh process | Overrides grouped scaling row chunks. Wrong values fail the sealed profile or change graph/timing. |
| `RPU_L2_ROUTED_ONLY` | Off; **E1** | Expert weight installation / **MODEL** | Isolates routed-expert contribution for bisection. Output is not full-model output. |
| `RPU_L2_SCHUNK` | `32512`; positive decimal, non-positive uses default | Graph emission / **BUILD** | Overrides grouped activation host chunking. It changes graph census and may reduce safety/performance. |

| `RPU_PI05_LOG_CONVERSION` | Off by absence; any non-empty value, including `0`, enables | Gemma prefill / **CALL** | Logs conversion/handle/chunk diagnostics. Adds output and may expose model shape/configuration. |
| `RPU_PI05_PROBE_DIR` | Unset; non-empty directory path | Pi0.5 conversion and forwards / **CALL** | Dumps named inputs, activations, and KV tensors as `.pt`. Artifacts can contain model weights and user data. |
| `RPU_RHINOVLA_VISION_RPU_MERGERS_MEM_DEBUG` | **PB(false)** | Vision installation/materialization / **MODEL** | Prints allocator summaries around merger materialization. Adds synchronization and exposes memory structure. |
| `RPU_SIGLIP_ISOLATE_PATCH_EMBED` | Off; non-empty except `0`/`false`/`False` | First segment planning / **NATIVE** | Isolates Pi0.5 patch-embedding segments to diagnose graph-finalization failures. Changes graph segmentation. |
| `RPU_WALL_OSS_INSTRUMENT` | **PB(false)** | Wall-OSS forward stages / **CALL** | Prints host stage timings. Instrumentation overhead makes the same run unsuitable for clean latency reporting. |
| `RPU_WALL_OSS_PROLOGUE_FILLER` | Empty; arbitrary string | Prompt construction / **CALL** | Appends diagnostic content to the prompt. It changes tokens and makes output unsuitable for correctness claims. |
| `RPU_WALL_OSS_VISION_DEVICE_MERGED` | **PB(false)** | Vision construction / **MODEL** | Keeps the eager merged result on RPU as a diagnostic alternative to the normal fused route. Changes ownership/topology. |
| `WALL_OSS_PROFILE_PREFIX` | Unset; decimal integer target length | Each prediction / **CALL**; forbidden with prepared production Graphs | Truncates trailing text for a profiling shape after preserving image tokens. Resulting actions are meaningless. |

## Non-environment runtime controls

Prefer these public APIs over new environment switches.

### Cold per-handle `rpu_execution`

Public loaders and policies accept an immutable `rpu_execution` mapping. The
three possible stages are `prefill`, `vision`, and `action`; each entry point
advertises the subset it supports and rejects every other stage or field before
weight loading.

| Field | Accepted value | Meaning and lifecycle |
|---|---|---|
| `chunk_size` | `"auto"` or a positive integer multiple of 16 | Planner cap/choice for the named stage. It is bound to the model or policy; construct a new one to change it. |
| `padding_rows` | `"auto"` or a non-negative integer | Exact/automatic execution padding for the named stage. An exact integer is mutually exclusive with `padding_budget`. |
| `padding_budget` | Non-negative integer | Maximum optional padding considered by the stage planner. It cannot accompany an exact integer `padding_rows`. |

All three stage mappings are cold even when a field influences only one Graph:
pass them to the loader/factory before RPU weight installation and first Graph
BUILD. The adapter may narrow a request to its exact capability envelope and
will expose the resolved execution plan where its public policy API documents
one.

### Memory and coherency controls

- `torch.rpu.set_caching_allocator(bool)` toggles the process caching allocator
  (default off). `torch.rpu.empty_cache()` releases cached, unused blocks; it
  cannot release live tensors or Graph-owned storage.
- `torch.rpu.memory_stats()` and `torch.rpu.get_memory_stats()` return allocator
  counters. `reset_peak_memory_stats()` resets peak counters, while
  `reset_accumulated_memory_stats()` resets accumulated allocation/free
  counters. Resetting counters does not free memory.
- `torch.rpu.set_ddr_flush(bool)` controls internal RPU-to-RPU flush points
  (default off). Model adapters may set it when their cross-component contract
  requires it.
- `torch.rpu.set_ddr_flush_force(bool)` controls CPU/RPU boundary coherency
  (default on). Keep it enabled for normal inference; disabling it is unsafe
  outside an isolated microbenchmark. The matching `get_*` functions report
  current process state.

### Profiling mechanisms

| Mechanism | What it measures | When to enable | Output/risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `torch.rpu.set_profile(True)` | Backend wrapper and accumulated timing counters | After warmup if only steady-state counters are wanted; call `reset_profile_accumulators()` before the measured window | Lightweight console/counter diagnostics; it is not a PyTorch operation trace. |
| `torch.profiler.profile(...)` | CPU and `PrivateUse1` operation scopes, including Graph capture/replay ranges | Wrap only the calls to measure; include warmup separately according to the benchmark protocol | Produces an operation-level trace/table and adds profiler overhead. |
| `torch.rpu.hw_perf_trace(output_dir, max_dumps=32)` | r4 device kernel/DMA durations per Graph segment, plus stream/core/channel scheduling metadata | Enable before the first forward in a fresh process; inspect `*_replay_segN.json` and combine all segments | Produces bounded Perfetto-compatible JSON. Release output redacts readable kernel names, op types, and addresses; it is not a full PMU profiler. |

`LKN_RPU_FREQ_MHZ` controls only cycle-to-time conversion in the r4 hardware
trace. It does not enable collection. If unset, the runtime uses 800 MHz; set it
to the board's actual frequency or every trace duration will be scaled by the
same wrong ratio. Hardware collection perturbs execution, so measure final
latency in a separate fresh process with hardware tracing disabled.

## Inventory maintenance

The tables contain one row for each current concrete environment/configuration
name. A new reader or facade preset must add a row in the correct tier; removing
the final reader/preset requires removing its row. Automated documentation
checks should compare the row set bidirectionally with source readers and keep
diagnostic variables below the stable `Diagnostic-only inventory` heading.
